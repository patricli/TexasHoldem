# TexasHoldem

Following the Python workshop for AI @ Columbia UMC meetup  (https://www.meetup.com/AI-at-CUMC/), we are 
learning Computer Science, Programing, and the math needed for Data Science and Machine Learning from ... learning to gamble. We will be creating a Texas Hold'em Poker app over the next couple of weeks (or months) whole progressively learning and adding more complex features including an AI that plays against the players and learns over time. With this we will be learning the fundamentals that make up the fields of AI, Data Science, and Computer Science. 

Why Gambling: 

We aren't going to gamble real money. But, the foundations of probability theory are based on gamblers trying to solve certain problems. This approach reduces dependencies of knowledge and frameworks. We start from bottom up. No prior knowledge or domain knowledge is needed. We will build upon abstractions from beginning to N.

We will collaboratively learn and build frameworks from first principles. We will eventually build the functions that are used in popular libraries first to understand them in depth. Then we can start to use them and replace them with the popular libraries used by many. This manner is fun, straight forward. There are no assumptions, and we have simple rules. The foundations of probability, statistics which build up to machine learning and data science can be found in games of skill and chance. These same concepts can be immediately translated to medicine and other fields. This approach will allow us to also learn math via programming and vice versa. 

Here is our first initial objectives to hit. Mind you the time to complete each may be off the optimistic timeline. Feel free to comment and add suggestions:

Shout out to Kenny Warner for creating the basic rubric.
